					The first lesson I learned is the importance of having a plan for your code.  I went in randomly coding bits and pieces and it was a mess.  After restructuring the project and going with an object oriented design my productivity increased.  I was able to add more content and the codebase was far more manageable.</p>

					The next big lesson was consistency in the style of code.  After going with a consistent design philosophy it became much easier to manage.</p>

					All together the project taught me a ton.  It was also a very enjoyable experience and seeing others play my game, find bugs, and give feedback, so that I could further improve the game, was a great experience.
