                                Space Lich Omega is an incremental RPG that was inspired by the game Candy Box.  The player must go through many levels and eventually defeat The Lich.  Throughout the game they gather items to boost their strength and have to face questions of morality.
                            </p>
                            <p class = "projectTextParagraph">
                                I took up the project because Candy Box was one of the things that had made me interested in web development in the first place.  I also used it as an oppurtunity to learn JQuery as well as expand upon my vanilla JavaScript skills.
                            </p>
                        </div><!--projectText-->

                        <div class = "projectText six columns">
                            <h2 class = "projectTextHeader">Challenges</h2>
                            <p class = "projectTextParagraph">
                                This was my first project that had extended beyond a week or two of developing time.  I didn't realize the scale of such a project and so I had a few problems.
                            </p>
                            <p class = "projectTextParagraph">
                                The first lesson I learned is the importance of having a plan for your code.  I went in randomly coding bits and pieces and it was a mess.  After restructuring the project and going with an object oriented design my productivity increased.  I was able to add more content and the codebase was far more manageable.
                            </p>
                            <p class = "projectTextParagraph">
                                The next big lesson was consistency in the style of code.  After going with a consistent design philosophy it became much easier to manage.
                            </p>
                            <p class = "projectTextParagraph">
                                All together the project taught me a ton.  It was also a very enjoyable experience.  Seeing others play my game, find bugs, and give feedback so that I could further improve the game was a great experience.
                            </p>
